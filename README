# Notes-Maria-Db

Simple containerized mariadb database to hold notes records.
This repository uses the [MariaDb Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb) 

### Extending the base Db

To add additional tables or procedures, just create the script and save it in the 
base folder. During the build process, the scripts located in this folder will be executed 
against the notes-db database.

### Adding changes in local environment

You can execute `make bulid` in the repo root directory to build the image and test the 
changes done in local environment before pushing changes to the remote repository.

Don't forget to check the [MariaDb Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb) for additional details.
